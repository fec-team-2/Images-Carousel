## Usage

> In order to implement this module you will need to create your own Amazon S3 Bucket and upload at least 100 images to the bucket.
For finding 100 images that are related to the product built I used a Google Chrome extension called ImageAssistant Batch Downloader which allows you to search for images in Google and download batches of 50 images at once.

## Requirements

An `nvmrc` file is included if using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

- Node 6.13.0
- Check the package.json file

## Development

### Installing Dependencies
